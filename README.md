# PDF Q&A Chatbot ðŸ¤–

This is a PDF Q&A Chatbot built using Streamlit and Hugging Face's Transformers. The application allows users to upload a PDF document, extract text from it, and interact with a chatbot that can answer questions related to the content of the PDF using a BERT-based question-answering model.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Upload any PDF file to extract its text content.
- **Question Answering**: Ask questions about the PDF content and receive answers based on the BERT-based model.
- **Interactive Interface**: A user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit App**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Upload a PDF File**

   - Use the file uploader in the sidebar to upload a PDF document.

3. **Ask Questions**

   - After uploading the PDF, type your questions in the text input box to receive answers based on the document's content.

## Dependencies

- `streamlit`: Used for creating the web application interface.
- `PyPDF2`: Used for extracting text from PDF files.
- `transformers`: Provides the pre-trained BERT model for question answering.
- `torch`: Required by the transformers library for model inference.

## Notes

- Make sure to set up your Hugging Face API key if you plan to use private models or access additional Hugging Face features. Update the `HF_HOME_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key in the code.
